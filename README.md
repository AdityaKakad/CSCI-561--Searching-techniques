# CSCI-561--Searching-techniques
This project was completed as a part of my coursework for the course CSCI 561: Foundations in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Southern California, Fall 2019.

## Repository structure:

* **question.pdf** : contains the assignment description, including the description, and the input and output format specification.
* **solution.py** : main python code that contains the code for the assignment
* **testcases** : folder that contains a set 0f 50 testcases divided between BFS, UCS, and A* search inputs (check question.pdf for input format)
* **correct_outputs** : the list of expected outputs for the 50 test cases
* **namita_outputs** : outputs that I got on running solution.py on my system
* **myrun.sh** : run this sh file on system to automatically run the solution.py file for the 50 testcases given in the folder 
* **hw1_check.py** : called by myrun.sh to check the validity of the outputs received vs the expected outputs
